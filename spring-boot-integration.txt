If this app were to consume a Spring Boot backend instead of the public API, here’s how I would approach it:

1. Update the API Endpoint  
Replace the current fetch URL in `features/users/userApi.js`:
From:  
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users  
To:  
  https://api.afristec.com/api/users  
This assumes the Spring Boot backend exposes a `/api/users` endpoint.

2. Handle CORS  
Ensure the Spring Boot backend allows cross-origin requests from the frontend (http://localhost:5173) to prevent CORS-related browser errors.

3.  Secure the API with JWT  
I’d configure Spring Boot to issue and verify JWTs for secure API access since we are handling internal user data, to protect against social engineering and related authentication attacks.
